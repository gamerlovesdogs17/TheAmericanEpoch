 sloped_armor:0 "Sloped Armor"
 sloped_armor_desc:0 "Armor placed at an angle to an incoming shell has a much greater effective thickness than the same amount of armor placed vertically. It also increases the chance that the shell will simply bounce off harmlessly. However, it requires the entire tank to be designed around it, making the vehicle more difficult to assemble."
 stabilizer:0 "Stabilizer"
 stabilizer_desc:0 "A mechanical device to keep the gun pointing in the same direction when the tank is moving. While not advanced enough to allow accurate firing on the move, it does allow the gunner to fire accurately during a short stop, without having to re-acquire the target."
 smoke_launchers:0 "Smoke Launchers"
 smoke_launchers_desc:0 "A battery of pyrotechnic devices that can be triggered from inside the tank to create a thick cloud of smoke to hide the tank. Very useful when on the defensive or after driving into an ambush."
 extra_ammo_storage:0 "Extra Ammunition Storage"
 extra_ammo_storage_desc:0 "Additional racks of ready ammunition allow the tank to stay in the fight much longer without resupply. However, if the armor is penetrated, the results are likely to be catastrophic. This is particularly problematic when attacking."
 wet_ammo_storage:0 "Wet Ammunition Storage"
 wet_ammo_storage_desc:0 "Water jackets added to ammunition racks dramatically reduce the risk of the ammunition exploding after the tank is hit, which is greatly appreciated by the crews."

 long_range_radio:0 "Long Range Radio"
 long_range_radio_desc:0 "The strongest tank radio sets in WW2, operating at 50 watts, tended to be useless over 10 kilometers. The strongest tank radio sets of the 1970s, however, could easily communicate over 50+ kilometers. This, combined with pulse code modulation encryption, has resulted in near-perfect communication between entire battalions of tanks."
 tank_composite_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
 tank_composite_armor_desc:0 "By sandwiching either glass, silicon, or some other material, between two plates of steel, an armor plate is much better at resisting impacts compared to an equivalent thickness of pure steel. However, the time and materials both result in a higher cost."
 tank_spaced_armor:0 "Spaced Armor"
 tank_spaced_armor_desc:0 "While not as effective at stopping kinetic rounds as composite armor, simply having a gap between two armor plates can protect against shaped charge munitions, and is generally a fair bit cheaper."
 reactive_plate:0 "Reactive Plate"
 reactive_plate_desc:0 "Reactive armor uses a small explosive charge sandwiched between two metal plates to disrupt the effect of shaped charge munitions. By detonating right as the shaped charge goes off, a small reactive plate can withstand even the heaviest of explosively-formed penetrators."
 early_gps:0 "Early GPS"
 early_gps_desc:0 "GPS - Global Positioning Systems. While this early implementation isn't terribly accurate, and has issues with reliability, it allows a tank crew to know their position in the world within 100 meters, a huge tactical advantage."
 modern_gps:0 "Modern GPS"

 adv_dozer_blade:0 "Advanced Dozer Blade"
 adv_dozer_blade_desc:0 "By using stronger motors, as well as lifting arms and a ridged head, this blade can dig up even moderately rough soil."
 modern_dozer_blade:0 "Modern Dozer Blade"
 modern_dozer_blade:0 "While not much different mechanically from previous models, this blade has a much smaller form factor when stowed, as well as using composite alloys to enable using all but solid stone for entrenchment."
 adv_optics:0 "Advanced Optics"
 adv_optics_desc:0 "The earliest tank optics were literally holes or slits cut into the hull, so the crew could look out. This was dangerous, as bullet fragments and shrapnel could enter, resulting in often lethal injuries. While vision blocks and periscopes have helped somewhat, the clarity of these devices is still not great. However, as manufacturing methods are refined, new vision devices can be developed which allow for unprecedented levels of visibility and crew awareness."
 em_optics:0 "Early Modern Optics"
 em_optics_desc:0 "By using multi-layer scratch-resistent glass, a clear sight picture is established. Combined with rotating mounts, the crew is able to be adequately aware of their surroundings."
 modern_optics:0 "Modern Optics"
 modern_optics_desc:0 "With the development of night vision, special periscopes were developed which were interchangeable with regular periscopes, but were designed to see in the infrared range. This, combined with laminated silicon-glass, enables the tank crew to notice things that previously would have been invisible."
 wp_smoke:0 "WP Smoke"
 wp_smoke_desc:0 "White phosphorus, or 'Willy Pete', is an incendiary mixture which causes intense burns to the skin, as well as creating a thick blanket of smoke."
 cutting_corner:0 "Cutting corners"
 cutting_corner_desc:0 "By using cheaper steel, simplified casts, and omitting some features such as heat treatment or lamination, we can significantly reduce the time and expense involved in building a vehicle. However, this will result in far more frequent breakdowns, and may not be worth it in the long run."
 lean_fuel:0 "Lean Fuel"
 lean_fuel_desc:0 "The internal combustion engine combines both oxygen and fuel, usually gasoline or diesel, to create power. By using less fuel per ignition, and with artificial additives such as ethanol, we can decrease the oil usage of our vehicles. However, this may result in more frequent breakdowns - an engine running on a leaner mix will, paradoxically, run much hotter compared to an engine running rich."
 fair_repair:0 "Fair Repair"
 adv_auto_loader:0 "Advanced Auto Loader"
 adv_auto_loader_desc:0 "Early auto loaders were limited by their inherent unreliability, and the need to re-load them every 4 or 5 rounds. They also tended to require human work to complete the loading process. However, this model is truly automated, has space for at least 7 rounds, and is far more reliable."
 earlt_modern_auto_loader:0 "Early Modern Auto Loader"
 earlt_modern_auto_loader_desc:0 "Previous auto loaders tended to be of a 'drum' design - 7 to 10 rounds, in a rotating drum, places below the gun breech. Such a design was simple, small, and fast - but the drum could only hold one type of ammo, and manual loading was required for different types. This auto loader, by comparison, is much more adaptive, enabling several different types of rounds to be loaded via the auto loader. While not advanced enough to fully eliminate the need for a loader crewmember, this system greatly reduces the fatigue experience by human loaders."
 modern_auto_loader:0 "Modern Auto Loader"
 modern_auto_loader_desc:0 "An auto loader system reliable enough to eliminate the need for a human loader, while providing a dependable rate-of-fire over an extended period of time. With a capacity upwards of 20 rounds, and the ability to complete the loading process without any human intervention, this expensive system is excellent for a tank on the attack."
 advanced_reactive_plate:"Advanced Reactive Plate"
 advanced_reactive_plate_desc: "With a better explosive mixture, and a smaller delay between activation and detonation, this plate can withstand even high-velocity sabot shells."
 advanced_tank_composite_armor:0"Advanced Composite Armor"
 advanced_tank_composite_armor_desc:0 "Early composite armor involved just a few layers, usually steel-glass-steel or some such arrangement. By combining many layers of composite materials, sandwiched between steel plates, this armor layout is expensive but provides unparalleled protection against all types of munitions."
 hard_kill_system:0"Hard Kill Device"
 hard_kill_system_desc:0"Hard kill systems are designed to destroy incoming projectiles, either missiles or even shells, by responding with a projectile of their own. With high-speed computers and sensors, a small metal plate can destroy an incoming danger within milliseconds."
 apfsds:0"APFSDS Shell"
 apfsds_desc:0 "Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot Shells, or APFSDS for short, are a type of high-velocity armor piercing munition that can defeat all but the absolute heaviest of armor. They are so fast, that they won't even ricochet - they will shatter on a heavy angle instead."
 atgm:0"ATGM Launcher"
 atgm_desc:0"The Anti-Tank Guided Missile launcher, or ATGM launcher, uses either wired or wireless communication systems to guide a missile equipped with a shaped charge warhead to a target, usually a tank."
 heat_fs:0"HEAT-FS Shell"
 heat_fs_desc:0"High Explosive Anti Tank, Fin Stabilized, or HEAT-FS for short, is an evolution of previous HEAT shells. With a concave front, a so-called shaped charge lined with copper can penetrate thick armor. However, when the shell is spinning, as when fired out of a rifle gun, the copper penetrator will dissipate, resulting in much reduced armor penetration performance. Stabilizing fins counteract this rotation, resulting in a charge that can penetrate almost half a meter of steel armor."

 tank_heavy_machine_gun_desc:0 "A machine gun provides decent anti-infantry capability for a low cost. Even with special armor-piercing ammunition, its anti-armor performance leaves a lot to be desired."
 flamethrower:0 "Flamethrower"
 flamethrower_desc:0 "A device to project a stream of burning liquid. While very useful in urban combat and against fortifications, it offers no anti-armor capability and has to be used by a specially-trained crew in a separate unit to be effective."
 tank_auto_cannon:0 "20mm Autocannon"
 tank_auto_cannon_desc:0 "Adapted from a fast-firing anti-air gun, this automatic cannon can lay down a hail of fire that is devastating to soft targets. The small caliber does limit its anti-armor performance."

 tank_anti_air_cannon_3_desc:0 "A fast-firing automatic gun designed to engage aircraft. It has limited potential as a fire-support weapon against ground targets."
 early_modern_anti_air_cannon:0"Twin 37mm AA Guns"
 early_modern_anti_air_cannon_desc:0"With the introduction of jet aircraft, older anti-aircraft guns are simply incapable of dealing with modern aircraft. As such, the development of a smaller caliber, but much higher velocity gun is the natural evolution - while not necessarily capable of destroying an aircraft in a single hit, the higher muzzle velocity means aiming is simplified."
 modern_anti_air_cannon:0"Rotary 20mm AA Gun"
 modern_anti_air_cannon_desc:0"A multi-barrel rotary autocannon, capable of shredding a line clean through the sky - with devastating effects on any unfortunate aircraft caught in the way."

 #Artillery
 tank_close_support_gun:0 "57mm L/21 Support Gun"
 tank_close_support_gun_desc:0 "A small weapon designed to fire high-explosive shells against enemy field fortifications to help the infantry on the attack. While capable of engaging tanks, its short barrel and limited ammunition make it unable to deal with more powerful enemy tanks."
 tank_medium_howitzer:0 "105mm L/31 Howitzer"
 tank_medium_howitzer_desc:0 "A medium field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armor-percing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."

 armor_tech_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Improved Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_2_desc:0 "With heavier and heavier anti-tank weapons being fielded around the world, the next generation of tanks will require even better protection."
 armor_tech_3:0 "Advanced Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_3_desc:0 "While the limit of deployed anti-tank guns has likely been reached, a new generation of tanks will carry more advanced weaponry, which is able to pierce any current level of protection at long range."
 armor_tech_4:0 "Modern Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 armor_tech_5:0 "Post War Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_5_desc:0 "While superheavy tanks are arguably not as useful as once believed, new welding and casting techniques have resulted in the ability to make extremely thick steel, capable of withstanding heavy punishment."
 armor_tech_7:0 "Early Cold War Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_7_desc:0 "Composite armor layouts can protect against munitions much better than equivalent thickness steel plates, while weighing much less."
 armor_tech_9:0 "Mid Cold War Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_9_desc: "Rather than increasing the thickness of armor to impractical levels, we should instead invest in making 'smarter' armor - which, while taking up more space, weighs much less than steel."
 armor_tech_10:0 "Late Cold War Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_10_desc:0 "Advancements are always possible with armor protection. Whether improved chemistry, or stronger composites, tanks of the future will be very well protected."
 armor_tech_11:0 "Post Cold War Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_11_desc:0 "With the third generation of main battle tanks, with advanced high-velocity cannons firing rounds that can penetrate nearly a meter of steel, we need to protect our crewmembers and vehicles."
 engine_tech_1:0 "Basic Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."
 engine_tech_2:0 "Improved Engine"
 engine_tech_2_desc:0 "With bigger guns and heavier armor, the new generation of tanks requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3:0 "Advanced Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc:0 "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 engine_tech_4:0 "Late War Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."
 engine_tech_5:0 "Post War Engine"
 engine_tech_5_desc:0"While the modern engines are already fairly capable, there are always advances to be made. New technologies such as multi-barrel carburettors and forced induction allow much higher power outputs."
 engine_tech_7:0 "Early Cold War Engine"
 engine_tech_7_desc:0"As tanks reach towards 60 tonnes in weight, we need engines with over a thousand horsepower to keep up with the other mechanized arms of service."
 engine_tech_9:0 "Mid Cold War Engine"
 engine_tech_9_desc:0"Improvements to fuel quality and precision engineering, as well as novel new materials, enable engines that can propel a vehicle at highway speeds."
 engine_tech_10:0 "Late Cold War Engine"
 engine_tech_10_desc:0"Only so much can be done to improve existing models. Eventually, we will need to develop brand new designs, for both diesel and gas turbine engines, to take full advantage of new technologies."
 engine_tech_11:0 "Post Cold War Engine"
 engine_tech_11_desc:0 "The modern tank engine must be fast, yet reliable - it must not choke in dusty environments, or fail to start when it is cold out. With fuel injection and twinchargers, engines can be made that produce obscene amounts of power."
