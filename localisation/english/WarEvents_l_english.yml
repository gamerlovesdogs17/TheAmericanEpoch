waev.1.d:0 "After intense combat between the Iraqi government and the revolting Iraqi communists, the Iraqi government was able to declare victory after the successful defeat of the communists. As a consequence of this result, communism in the middle east has been hit hard, as in the middle east, communism is unable to gain popularity that communist countries want in order to "expand their revolution"."
waev.1.a:0 "The Iraqi government holds."
waev.2.t:0 "Iranian Democratic Oppposition Crushed"
waev.2.d:0 "The democratic opposition in Iran has been defeated in the Iranian civil war. Despite this, the ball has already begun rolling in the Middle East, as democratic support expands throught the nations of the middle east. This 2 year civil war has resulted in a major loss of life though, for both sides. How the Iranian government will act now is unknown now that the civil war is over. It is expected they will purge their government of those who supported the opposition and supplied them with intel."
waev.2.a:0 "Interesting."
