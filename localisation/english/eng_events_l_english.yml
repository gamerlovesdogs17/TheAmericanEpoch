guy_c.1.t:0 "Britain Leaves Guyana"
guy_c.1.d:0 "Earlier today, British forces left Guyana. This will officially end British Colonization in South America, ignoring the Falklands and South Georgia Island. American reactions to this are mixed, as the new government in charge has already openly stated their want to join the Democratic League. It seems a crisis could potentially erupt if the American government chooses to intervene and launch a coup. Guyana's independance has been supported by Brazil for years now, so American intervention will be met with resistance by the Democratic League."
guy_c.1.a:0 "And so we wait."

usa.82.a:0 "How dare they demand our independance."
