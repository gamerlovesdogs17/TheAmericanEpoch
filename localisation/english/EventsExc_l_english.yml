This is occuring as neighbors in the Middle East come under the threat of conflict. This is seen as a power play showing the potential future foreign policy of India of expanding the Democratic League. Syria has stated this as a major move in their sovereignty and protecting themselves from tyrants. India stated it as a step in keeping the Middle East free, well Turkey states it as a success in protecting fellow democratic nations."
