 USA_1966_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "It has been many years since William Taft took office and began a trend leading to a authoritarian democracy. His successors slowly took away rights as checks and balances fell apart. Gripping onto power as elections slowly becoming less competitive. Opposition became suppressed under the guise of national security. A economic crash was barely avoided thanks to centralized control of the economy, and that allowed the USA to quickly come into WW2 after the Japanese attack and beat the Germans. This allowed the USA to force nations to join a American world order based on their authoritarianism.
