 comp70_desc:0 "By beginning of the 1970s there were essentially two types of computers. There were room-sized mainframes, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, that were built one at a time by companies such as IBM and CDC. There also were smaller, cheaper, mass-produced minicomputers, costing tens of thousands of dollars, that were built by a handful of companies, such as Digital Equipment Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company, for scientific laboratories and businesses."

 tv_guide:0 "Television guidance" 
 tv_guide_desc:0 "Television guidance (TGM) is a type of missile guidance system using a television camera in the missile or glide bomb that sends its signal back to the launch platform. There, a weapons officer or bomb aimer watches the image on a television screen and sends corrections to the missile, typically over a radio control link. Television guidance is not a seeker because it is not automated, although semi-automated systems with autopilots to smooth out the motion are known. They should not be confused with contrast seekers, which also use a television camera but are true automated seeker systems." 
 ir_guide:0 "Infrared homing" 
 ir_guide_desc:0 "Infrared homing is a passive weapon guidance system which uses the infrared (IR) light emission from a target to track and follow it. Missiles which use infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers", since infrared is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines and aircraft generate and emit heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background." 
 laser_guide:0 "Laser guidance" 
 laser_guide_desc:0 "Laser guidance is used by military to guide a missile or other projectile or vehicle to a target by means of a laser beam (Lidar), e.g. beam riding guidance or semi-active radar homing (SARH).[7] This technique is sometimes called SALH, for Semi-Active Laser Homing. With this technique, a laser is kept pointed at the target and the laser radiation bounces off the target and is scattered in all directions (this is known as "painting the target", or "laser painting"). The missile, bomb, etc. is launched or dropped somewhere near the target. When it is close enough for some of the reflected laser energy from the target to reach it, a laser seeker detects which direction this energy is coming from and adjusts the projectile trajectory towards the source." 
 laser_guide_mun:0 "Precision-guided munition" 
 laser_guide_mun_desc:0 "A precision-guided munition (PGM, smart weapon, smart munition, smart bomb) is a guided munition intended to precisely hit a specific target, to minimize collateral damage and increase lethality against intended targets.Because the damage effects of explosive weapons decrease with distance due to an inverse cube law, even modest improvements in accuracy (hence reduction in miss distance) enable a target to be attacked with fewer or smaller bombs. Thus, even if some guided bombs miss, fewer air crews are put at risk and the harm to civilians and the amount of collateral damage may be reduced."

 aam60:0 "BVR missiles"

 ###NAVAL TREE### 
 ship_hull_light_5:"1950 Destroyer Hull" 
 ship_hull_light_5_desc:"Destroyers laid down in the 5 years after the war still mostly resemble those of the previous generation, but with a few advantages - they tended to have fully automatic main guns, as well as an advanced suite of radar and sonar detection systems." 
 ship_hull_light_6:"1955 Destroyer Hull" 
 ship_hull_light_6_desc:"With the proliferation of the transistor, tasks that previously required dozens of men, such as manning a radar suite, now only require one or two. These ships are fast, deadly, and among the most technologically advanced in our navy." 
 ship_hull_light_7:"1960 DDG" 
 ship_hull_light_7_desc:"The advent of accurate surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles has changed naval warfare. Even a modest destroyer carries enough firepower to sink any foe, and this design is the culmination of efforts to bring these weapons to the sea." 
 ship_hull_light_8:"1970 DDG" 
 ship_hull_light_8_desc:"As radar becomes ever more powerful and accurate, we must design our new ships with such systems in mind. A simple slab side, with a smaller cross profile compared to older vessels, as well as an advanced set of missiles for destroying any foe, whether in the sky or on water, has resulted in a vessel which looks to be of space-age." 
 ship_hull_light_9:"1980 DDG" 
 ship_hull_light_9_desc:"With the development of computing systems that no longer require an entire building to house, this destroyer is the first truly computerized vessel. Designed to be difficult to spot on radar, equipped with a fully electronic fire control and command system, and a vast array of weapons for any situation, this vessel is a truly modern warship." 
 ship_hull_light_10:"1990 DDG" 
 ship_hull_light_10_desc:"As we enter the electronic age, we must not forget to modernize our navy. As such, this warship is equipped with electronic jamming equipment, predictive fire control systems, and a vertical-launch system for missiles of nearly any kind." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_5:"1950 Cruiser Hull" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc:"By the end of the war, it has become clear that naval aviation has truly changed warfare at sea. We must develop a fast, well armored vessel with a vast array of anti-aircraft cannons, as well as a modern radar suite, suited perfectly to escort our capital ships." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_6:"1955 Cruiser Hull" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc:"The last of the cruisers equipped with conventional guns, this vessel is equipped with transistor-powered computers that allow for accurate fire over long distances. It is also very well armored, yet still fast to keep up with our heaviest warships." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_7:"Missile Cruiser Hull" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_7_desc:"With the development of viable surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, which can hit a target over hundreds of kilometers, has necessitated a cruiser capable of wielding these new weapons." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_8:"1970 Guided Missile Cruiser" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_8_desc:"The increasingly automated systems of cruisers allow us to lay down a vessel with fewer men, yet with greater firepower than ever before." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_9:"1980 Guided Missile Cruiser" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_9_desc:"As nuclear power becomes more viable, we can lay down a vessel designed to utilize the energy of the atom. Capable of operating at sea for weeks or even months at a time, these vessels have an endurance which is unheard of." 
 ship_hull_cruiser_10:"1990 Guided Missile Cruiser" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_10_desc:"Computerization has resulted in a vessel with a large array of sensors, radars, and other equipment which has resulted in a truly modern warship." 
 ship_hull_heavy_5:"Converted Missile Heavy" 
 ship_hull_heavy_5_desc:"While naval aviation and surface-to-surface missiles have rendered our battleships obsolete, it would be wasteful to simply scrap the vessels that took so long to build. We should instead convert them into mobile, heavily armored missile warships, with the capability to launch dozens of missiles with devastating effects." 
 ship_hull_heavy_6:"Guided Missile Battlecruiser" 
 ship_hull_heavy_6_desc:"Essentially an upscaled missile cruiser, this vessel is the final evolution of the battleship. Massive, well armored, fast, and equipped with a vast array of pinpoint-accurate missiles, capable of leveling an entire city, as well as an advanced communication system and radar suite, this warship acts more like a floating command center than a naval vessel." 
 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_1:"60s Heavy aircraft cruiser" 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_1_desc:"The advantages of naval aviation are obvious - while the largest guns can hit a target at 20 kilometers, a single aircraft can drop a torpedo at ranges exceeding 100 kilometers, and with far greater accuracy. However, dedicated aircraft carriers are vulnerable if they are attacked directly. As such, a combination carrier/cruiser is proposed - bringing the best of both worlds with the downsides of neither." 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_2:"70s Heavy aircraft cruiser" 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_2_desc:"By integrating computers into the communication systems of our aircraft cruisers, the aviation and naval components can work together, usually with disastrous results to the enemy fleet." 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_3:"80s Heavy aircraft cruiser" 
 ship_hull_bc_carrier_3_desc:"As guns are replaced by missiles, and spotters replaced by radar suites, this warship is the culmination of decades of naval experience. Fast and lethal, capable of nearly any task, this vessel is a foe to be reckoned with." 
 
 ship_hull_carrier_5:"1950 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_5_desc:"The aircraft carriers built after the war generally resembled those of earlier years - large, relatively slow, heavy, and vulnerable to counter attack. While we lack the technology to rectify most of these issues, this vessel is much better protected from enemy attacks by both sea and air, using a combination of deck guns and radar suites." 
 ship_hull_carrier_6:"1955 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_6_desc:"Communication is critical for the effectiveness of an aircraft carrier, and as such this warship is equipped with an advanced radio system enabling the crew to respond within minutes to enemy activity." 
 ship_hull_carrier_7:"1960 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_7_desc:"As jet naval fighters become a necessity, this carrier is equipped with a longer runway to enable these new aircraft to perform their duties." 
 ship_hull_carrier_8:"1970 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_8_desc:"An advanced radar system, as well as the beginnings of nuclear propulsion, mark this warship's development. Between that, and the increasingly capable jets which will reside on it, this aircraft carrier is an extremely capable vessel." 
 ship_hull_carrier_9:"1980 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_9_desc:"As computers become more viable, the development of a new aircraft carrier to make full use of this technology is a must." 
 ship_hull_carrier_10:"1990 Carrier Hull" 
 ship_hull_carrier_10_desc:"An ever-greater focus on projecting naval power across the world has resulted in a fast and fearsome aircraft carrier, capable of nearly any task at hand." 
 ship_hull_submarine_5:"1950 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_5_desc:"As the war ends, the submarine has found itself as an absolute necessity for any naval power. Experimenting with longer dives, and to deeper depths, this vessel is a terrifying encounter for sure." 
 ship_hull_submarine_6:"1955 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_6_desc:"While not as impressive as a massive aircraft carrier, the modest submarine is arguably the most important part of any navy. Designed to be invisible to the newest sonar systems, this submarine is definitely a silent hunter." 
 ship_hull_submarine_7:"1960 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_7_desc:"As the nuclear age comes to submarines, the endurance of our under-sea fleet has skyrocketed. While a traditional submarine is only capable of being at sea for perhaps 2 weeks at a time, this vessel can go for months without resupply. Its range is limited by food stockpiles, rather than fuel amount." 
 ship_hull_submarine_8:"1970 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_8_desc:"By utilizing top-launch missiles, this submarine can launch a devastating attack without being in visible range of its target." 
 ship_hull_submarine_9:"1980 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_9_desc:"An improved layout, as well as space for vast amounts of provisions, means this submarine can stay at sea for almost a year." 
 ship_hull_submarine_10:"1990 Submarine Hull" 
 ship_hull_submarine_10_desc:"Sonar systems have become much stronger, and much more sensitive to the traditionally noisy operation of propellors. Experiments with pump-jet propulsors have shown great promise. While heavier, more expensive, and generally slower than a propellor, the pump-jet propulsor is nearly silent, and all but undetectable to any curious foes."

 ship_torpedo_sub_6_desc:0 "Improvments in the guidance as well as new materials enabled the torpedoes to be more acurate and fast." 
 ship_torpedo_sub_7:0 "1960 Sub Torpedo" 
 ship_torpedo_sub_7_desc:0 "A new guidance method was introduced in the 60s was Wake homing.The torpedo is fired to cross behind the stern of the target ship through the wake, as it does so it uses sonar to look for changes in the water caused by the passage of the ship, such as the small air bubbles. When these are detected the torpedo turns toward the ship then follows a zig-zag course, turning when it detects the outer edge of the wake, to keep itself in the wake. This will eventually bring it to the rear of the ship, where its warhead can do the most damage to propulsion and steering.The system is difficult to jam, though can be distracted by other ships crossing the wake." 
 ship_torpedo_sub_8:0 "1970 Sub Torpedo" 
 ship_torpedo_sub_8_desc:0 "They were designed to sink deep-diving nuclear-powered submarines and high-performance surface ships." 
 ship_torpedo_sub_9:0 "1980 Sub Torpedo" 
 ship_torpedo_sub_9_desc:0 "The 80s torpedo wasitted with both active and passive sonar and could be remotely controlled through a thin wire which connected it to the launching submarine. Wire guidance permits a torpedo to be launched on-first-warning, i.e. when a target is first detected at long range. This permits the torpedo the time needed to close the range while target course and speed is being updated by the submarine's superior sensors and transmitted 'down-the-wire'. The torpedo can also be reassigned to another target or recalled." 
 ship_torpedo_sub_10:0 "1990 Sub Torpedo" 
 ship_torpedo_sub_10_desc:0 "In a typical engagement, these new torpedoes will run out wire-guided to the general vicinity of the target and then conduct a covert passive search. The high-capacity guide wire system, specifically designed to match the Spearfish's manoeuvre and speed envelope, provides two-way data exchange between the torpedo and launch submarine, maximising the submarine's organic sensor and combat control capabilities.Once at close range the torpedo uses active sonar to classify and home in on its target. High-power transmissions and sophisticated signal processing enable it to accurately discriminate targets from background noise and ensure high resistance to acoustic countermeasures and/or evasive manoeuvres."

 naval_reactor:"Nuclear marine propulsion" 
 naval_reactor_desc:"Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear power plant. The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers. A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built." 
 naval_reactor_2:"Improved Nuclear marine propulsion" 
 naval_reactor_2_desc:"Early reactors were a heavy and expensive investment, often taking up twice as much space as a diesel engine. While these new reactors are still expensive, we have been able to make them much more powerful, and a lot safer for the operating crews." 
 
 heli_engines:"Rotor system" 
 heli_engines_desc:"A helicopter rotor system is the combination of several rotary wings and a control system that generates the aerodynamic lift force that supports the weight of the helicopter, and the thrust that counteracts aerodynamic drag in forward flight. Each main rotor is mounted on a vertical mast over the top of the helicopter, as opposed to a helicopter tail rotor, which connects through a combination of drive shaft(s) and gearboxes along the tail boom.The name is derived from the Greek words helix, helik-, meaning spiral; and pteron meaning wing."
