 startgame_gui_inf_description_txt_txt:0 "The year is 1966 and the world is in balance as 3 factions contest across the globe in a 3-way cold war. The United States, an authoritarian democracy led by Gerald L. K. Smith, leads the Global Treaty Organization, a faction against the Warsaw Pact and Democratic League. It became the successor of the Allied Powers after the German Reich was defeated in 1943, and the Japanese Empire in 1944. The Soviet Union, led by Leonid Brezhnev, leads the Warsaw Pact to the East. As the leader of the communist world, the Soviets vie to expand the Revolution across the globe against the "capitalist pigs." In Asia, India, the leader of the Democratic League, is led by Jawaharlal Nehru. India's goal is to work with its allies in the Democratic League to restore democracy to the world and spread freedom. This careful balance is at a breaking point, as both sides grow closer to war. One event can cause a chain reaction and start a fire no one wants to spark. Yet, despite the threat posed by war, all 3 of the sides vie to expand their influence or ideology across the world."
